# Installation logic

`installer.install` provides the main logic for processing wheel files to install them into a destination, as described in the {term}`wheel` specification.

This is abstracted away from the format of a wheel file via {class}`WheelSource`, and the writing/transformation operations via {class}`WheelDestination`.

## Usage

```{doctest}
>>> print("TODO: write this")
TODO: write this
```

## Reference

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: installer.install
```
